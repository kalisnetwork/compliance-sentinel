# Security Policy for Compliance Sentinel

This document defines the security and compliance policies that all code must adhere to. These rules are automatically enforced by the Compliance Sentinel system during development.

## Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: Default to secure state when errors occur
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at system boundaries

## Security Rules

### Rule 1: API Security and Authentication

**Policy**: All API endpoints must implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Requirements**:
- Every API endpoint must require authentication (except public health checks)
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (max 100 requests/minute per client)
- Use secure session management with proper timeout
- Validate all input parameters and sanitize outputs
- Log all authentication attempts and failures

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Endpoints without authentication decorators
- Missing rate limiting configuration
- Hardcoded API keys or tokens
- Unvalidated user inputs in API handlers

### Rule 2: Credential and Secret Management

**Policy**: Never hardcode sensitive credentials or secrets in source code.

**Requirements**:
- All secrets must be loaded from environment variables
- Use secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Never log sensitive information
- Use encrypted storage for configuration files containing secrets

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, database connections
- Secrets in configuration files committed to version control
- Logging statements that may expose sensitive data
- Unencrypted credential storage

### Rule 3: Dependency Vulnerability Management

**Policy**: All external dependencies must be validated against known vulnerabilities.

**Requirements**:
- Scan all dependencies for known CVEs before use
- Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Use dependency pinning with regular security updates
- Maintain Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Remove unused dependencies

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Dependencies with known high/critical vulnerabilities
- Outdated packages with available security updates
- Unused or unnecessary dependencies
- Dependencies from untrusted sources

### Rule 4: Input Validation and Sanitization

**Policy**: All user inputs must be properly validated and sanitized.

**Requirements**:
- Validate input types, formats, and ranges
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Apply encoding when outputting user data

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Command injection possibilities
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- Insufficient input validation

### Rule 5: Cryptographic Security

**Policy**: Use only approved cryptographic algorithms and implementations.

**Requirements**:
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- Implement proper key management and rotation
- Use secure random number generation
- Apply proper hashing for passwords (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)
- Ensure proper certificate validation

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Weak encryption algorithms (DES, MD5, SHA1 for passwords)
- Hardcoded encryption keys
- Improper random number generation
- Weak password hashing
- Disabled certificate validation

### Rule 6: Error Handling and Information Disclosure

**Policy**: Implement secure error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.

**Requirements**:
- Use generic error messages for user-facing errors
- Log detailed errors securely for debugging
- Implement proper exception handling
- Avoid stack traces in production responses
- Sanitize error messages

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Detailed error messages exposed to users
- Stack traces in API responses
- Logging of sensitive information
- Unhandled exceptions
- Information disclosure in error responses

### Rule 7: Secure Communication

**Policy**: All network communication must use secure protocols.

**Requirements**:
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all web communication
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Disable insecure protocols (HTTP, FTP, Telnet)
- Implement proper CORS policies

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- HTTP URLs in production code
- Disabled SSL/TLS verification
- Insecure protocol usage
- Overly permissive CORS settings
- Missing security headers

### Rule 8: Access Control and Authorization

**Policy**: Implement proper access control mechanisms.

**Requirements**:
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement proper session management
- Validate permissions for all operations
- Use secure authentication mechanisms
- Implement account lockout policies

**Code Patterns to Detect**:
- Missing authorization checks
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Insecure direct object references
- Session fixation vulnerabilities
- Weak authentication mechanisms

## Compliance Standards

This policy ensures compliance with:

- **OWASP Top 10** security risks
- **CWE/SANS Top 25** most dangerous software errors
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **ISO 27001** information security standards
- **SOC 2 Type II** security controls

## Enforcement

These policies are automatically enforced through:

1. **Real-time Analysis**: Code is scanned on every file save
2. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Violations block commits
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Security gates in deployment pipeline
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing vulnerability scanning

## Exceptions and Waivers

Security policy exceptions must be:

1. Documented with business justification
2. Approved by security team
3. Time-limited with review dates
4. Compensating controls implemented
5. Regularly reviewed and renewed

## Policy Updates

This policy is reviewed quarterly and updated as needed to address:

- New threat vectors
- Updated compliance requirements
- Technology changes
- Lessons learned from incidents
