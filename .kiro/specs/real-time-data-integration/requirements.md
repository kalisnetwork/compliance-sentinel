# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on removing hardcoded and mock data from the Compliance Sentinel codebase and implementing real-time data integration capabilities. The system currently contains numerous hardcoded values, test data, and mock configurations that need to be replaced with dynamic, environment-driven, and real-time data sources to make the system production-ready and adaptable to different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Environment-Based Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all configuration values to be loaded from environment variables or configuration files, so that I can deploy the system in different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load all configuration values from environment variables with fallback to configuration files
2. WHEN no environment variable is provided THEN the system SHALL use secure default values instead of hardcoded constants
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail gracefully
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading of non-critical configuration values
5. IF a required configuration value is missing THEN the system SHALL log an error and use a documented fallback value

### Requirement 2: Dynamic API Endpoint Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure external API endpoints dynamically, so that I can point the system to different vulnerability databases and compliance services based on the deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring MCP servers THEN the system SHALL accept endpoint URLs from environment variables
2. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL load them from secure environment variables or secret management systems
3. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN the system SHALL read limits from configuration rather than hardcoded values
4. WHEN timeout values are set THEN the system SHALL use configurable timeout values for all external API calls
5. IF external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement proper fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Vulnerability Data Integration

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to fetch real-time vulnerability data from live sources, so that I can get the most current security information for my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing vulnerability analysis THEN the system SHALL query live vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE, etc.)
2. WHEN vulnerability data is cached THEN the system SHALL implement configurable cache TTL values
3. WHEN new vulnerabilities are published THEN the system SHALL be able to fetch and incorporate them within configurable time intervals
4. WHEN external vulnerability services are down THEN the system SHALL fall back to cached data with appropriate warnings
5. IF vulnerability data is stale THEN the system SHALL indicate the age of the data in analysis results

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Security Rule Configuration

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to configure security analysis rules dynamically, so that I can adapt the system to different security policies and compliance requirements without code deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading security rules THEN the system SHALL read rule configurations from external files or databases
2. WHEN rule patterns are defined THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns loaded from configuration
3. WHEN severity thresholds are set THEN the system SHALL use configurable threshold values instead of hardcoded constants
4. WHEN custom rules are added THEN the system SHALL validate and load them without requiring system restart
5. IF rule configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with valid rules only

### Requirement 5: Environment-Specific Authentication

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want authentication mechanisms to be configurable per environment, so that I can integrate with different identity providers and security systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication backends configured via environment variables
2. WHEN JWT secrets are needed THEN the system SHALL load them from secure environment variables
3. WHEN API keys are generated THEN the system SHALL use configurable key formats and expiration policies
4. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific rate limit configurations
5. IF authentication configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL disable authentication features with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 6: Real-Time File System Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to monitor file changes in real-time using configurable patterns, so that I can get immediate feedback on security issues as I code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL detect changes using configurable file patterns
2. WHEN debounce timing is set THEN the system SHALL use configurable debounce delays instead of hardcoded values
3. WHEN file size limits are applied THEN the system SHALL use configurable maximum file sizes
4. WHEN directories are excluded THEN the system SHALL read exclusion patterns from configuration
5. IF file monitoring fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with manual analysis capabilities

### Requirement 7: Dynamic Cache Management

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want cache configurations to be dynamic and environment-specific, so that I can optimize performance based on available resources and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL use configurable TTL values for different data types
2. WHEN cache size limits are set THEN the system SHALL respect environment-specific memory constraints
3. WHEN cache keys are generated THEN the system SHALL use configurable key patterns and namespaces
4. WHEN cache cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL use configurable cleanup intervals and strategies
5. IF cache storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without caching and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 8: Live Compliance Framework Integration

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to fetch compliance requirements from live sources, so that I can ensure analysis reflects the most current regulatory standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance checks are performed THEN the system SHALL query live compliance framework APIs
2. WHEN compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL detect and incorporate updates within configurable intervals
3. WHEN multiple frameworks are supported THEN the system SHALL allow dynamic framework selection via configuration
4. WHEN compliance data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached requirements with staleness indicators
5. IF compliance framework APIs are unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide degraded functionality with clear user notifications

### Requirement 9: Environment-Aware Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want logging and monitoring configurations to adapt to the deployment environment, so that I can get appropriate visibility without overwhelming log systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging is configured THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific log levels and formats
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL send them to configurable monitoring endpoints
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL report them to environment-specific error tracking systems
4. WHEN performance data is gathered THEN the system SHALL use configurable sampling rates and retention policies
5. IF monitoring systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operation and buffer metrics when possible

### Requirement 10: Test Data Elimination

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all test and mock data removed from production code paths, so that the system operates only with real data in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs in production mode THEN it SHALL NOT use any hardcoded test data or mock responses
2. WHEN test fixtures are needed THEN they SHALL be clearly separated from production code and only available in test environments
3. WHEN sample data is provided THEN it SHALL be loaded from external files or generated dynamically based on configuration
4. WHEN debugging features are enabled THEN they SHALL be controlled by environment-specific feature flags
5. IF test data is accidentally accessed in production THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use real data instead
