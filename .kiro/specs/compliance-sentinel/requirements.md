# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Compliance Sentinel is an intelligent, proactive security and compliance enforcement system that integrates directly into the development workflow using Kiro's agentic capabilities. Unlike traditional static analysis tools that run post-development, this system provides real-time compliance checking, automated policy enforcement, and intelligent feedback during code development. The system operates through a closed-loop workflow using Agent Steering for policy definition, Agent Hooks for automated enforcement, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external intelligence integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Policy Definition and Management

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to define comprehensive security and compliance policies in a centralized document, so that all development activities automatically adhere to organizational security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security policy is defined THEN the system SHALL store it in `.kiro/steering/security.md` as the single source of truth
2. WHEN policies are updated THEN all agents SHALL automatically reference the updated rules in their context
3. WHEN defining policies THEN the system SHALL support rules for API security, credential management, dependency validation, and code patterns
4. IF a policy rule is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback
5. WHEN policies are created THEN they SHALL be automatically loaded into Kiro's steering context for all agents

### Requirement 2: Real-time Code Analysis and Enforcement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic security scanning triggered whenever I save code files, so that I can catch and fix security issues immediately without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer saves a Python file THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a security scan via Agent Hooks
2. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL check against all defined policies in the steering document
3. WHEN a security violation is detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback in the IDE with violation details and suggested fixes
4. WHEN scanning code THEN the system SHALL use Bandit for Python security pattern detection
5. WHEN analyzing code patterns THEN the system SHALL use Semgrep for custom security rule enforcement
6. IF no violations are found THEN the system SHALL provide a brief confirmation of compliance

### Requirement 3: External Vulnerability Intelligence Integration

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the system to query real-time vulnerability databases and regulatory APIs, so that compliance checks include the latest threat intelligence and regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing dependency analysis THEN the system SHALL query external vulnerability databases via MCP server
2. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL use OWASP Dependency-Check to scan against NVD database
3. WHEN connecting to external services THEN the system SHALL use a custom MCP server built with FastAPI and fastapi-mcp
4. WHEN external data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and continue with local analysis
5. WHEN vulnerability data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache results to minimize external API calls
6. IF external API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive static analysis that covers security vulnerabilities, code quality, and compliance violations, so that I can maintain high security standards across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing SAST THEN the system SHALL integrate Bandit for Python-specific security issue detection
2. WHEN analyzing code patterns THEN the system SHALL use Semgrep with custom rules for organizational policies
3. WHEN comprehensive analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL optionally integrate SonarQube for advanced code quality metrics
4. WHEN hardcoded secrets are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them and suggest environment variable alternatives
5. WHEN insecure cryptography is found THEN the system SHALL recommend secure alternatives with code examples
6. WHEN API endpoints are analyzed THEN the system SHALL verify authentication and rate-limiting implementation

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Feedback and Remediation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want actionable feedback with specific remediation suggestions, so that I can quickly understand and fix security issues without extensive research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a violation is detected THEN the system SHALL provide a clear explanation of the security risk
2. WHEN suggesting fixes THEN the system SHALL offer specific code examples and best practices
3. WHEN multiple violations exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by severity and impact
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL include references to relevant security standards and documentation
5. WHEN remediation is suggested THEN the system SHALL verify that proposed fixes don't introduce new violations
6. IF a violation cannot be automatically fixed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed manual remediation steps

### Requirement 6: Development Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration with my development environment, so that security compliance becomes a natural part of my coding workflow without additional overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is installed THEN it SHALL automatically configure Agent Hooks for file save events
2. WHEN working in the IDE THEN security feedback SHALL appear inline with code without disrupting the development flow
3. WHEN violations are found THEN they SHALL be highlighted directly in the code editor with contextual information
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL operate with minimal performance impact on the development environment
5. WHEN multiple files are modified THEN the system SHALL efficiently batch analysis operations
6. IF system resources are constrained THEN analysis SHALL be queued and processed asynchronously

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Customization

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to customize analysis rules and thresholds based on project requirements, so that the system can adapt to different security contexts and organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN custom rules SHALL be definable in the steering document
2. WHEN setting thresholds THEN severity levels SHALL be configurable for different types of violations
3. WHEN customizing analysis THEN specific file patterns SHALL be includable or excludable from scanning
4. WHEN integrating external tools THEN their configurations SHALL be manageable through the MCP server settings
5. WHEN updating configurations THEN changes SHALL take effect without requiring system restart
6. IF configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance
